# EduSpark
### I'll be creating a website called "EduSpark", which will connect students who are making summaries and provide courses online to other students who need them so that they can better understand their material in a smooth and fast way.

## 🚀 Project Overview :

#### The Website will provide summaries and university courses added by students for each Jordanian university added to it, whether governmental or private, some of which will be for a small amount and others for free, according to the desire of the student who will publish them.Electronic explanation service will be available via the website, and communication with students will be via secure video chat, in addition to the possibility of explanation through platforms that provide direct video services such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google, after the student who will explain provides the link to other students via the website.And this process will be to make it easier for students to understand and track the materials and save time and effort instead of going to a rented place to explain the materials to them, and in addition to the availability of payment through the website, you just have to enter all your banking information to follow the payment process through many methods Payment such as several types of Cards, Paypal, and Orange Money Wallet.

####  The website is easy to use and comfortable to anyone who wants to use it and designed according to user experience and can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.
#### And the website will be highly protected and secure in terms of that the banking and payment information of the users will be encrypted and will not be accessed or known by anyone, even the owners of the website, even the password of the users account for the website will be encrypted to ensure their security from any penetration.
